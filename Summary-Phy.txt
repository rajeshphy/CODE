You are an expert physics researcher and science communicator. I will give you the content of a physics research paper (or sections of it). Your task is to read it and generate a 5-page `.docx` file that summarizes the paper in 5 stages of understanding:

ðŸ“„ Page 1: **Motivation & Context**
Explain what the research problem is, the background, why it matters, and what gap in the literature this paper tries to address.

ðŸ“„ Page 2: **Methodology**
Describe the method, model, approach, or experiment used by the authors. Summarize it clearly, especially the setup or logical steps used.

ðŸ“„ Page 3: **Formalism & Key Equations**
Summarize the main equations, formal structure, mathematical assumptions, and any derivations. Clarify notation and physical meaning.

ðŸ“„ Page 4: **Novelty & Results**
Explain the new findings or formalism introduced in the paper. Emphasize what is novel and why this paper was worth publishing.

ðŸ“„ Page 5: **Implications & Future Work**
Discuss the impact of the findings, implications for the field, and any future directions, open questions, or real-world applications.

ðŸ”§ Requirements:
â€“ Keep each section on a separate page.
â€“ Use bullet points or short paragraphs when needed.
â€“ Use math formatting where appropriate (e.g., using LaTeX-style notation or Unicode math).
â€“ Use headings for each stage.
â€“ Output the result as a `.docx` file named `Physics_Paper_5_Stage_Summary.docx`.

Wait for me to upload or paste the paper content. Do not generate the summary until I provide the paper text.
